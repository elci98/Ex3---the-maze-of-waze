# Ex3---the-maze-of-waze
In this project we built a simple kind of "pacman" with 24  different scenarios each with different number of fruits and robots.<br>
This project is based on <a href="https://github.com/elci98/Ex2">Ex2 repository</a>.<br>
Our users will have two options when using our game:
* <h3>manual game</h3><br>
The manual game is played by mouse clicks - you need to click on the vertex you want to get to, if the scenario includes more than one robot, the closest robot to the clicked vertex is the one that will be moved.<br>
* <h3>automatic game</h3><br>
The automatic game is based on <a href="https://github.com/elci98/Ex2/blob/master/code/algorithms/Graph_Algo.java">Ex2 Repository algorithms</a>  move the robots automatically
